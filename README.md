# solo sprint 2

in this sprint, we were tasked with using HTML, CSS, and JS to create a portfolio website to host via our github accounts. it shows my rudimentary skills in the required languages.

i don't have really that much to report in terms of stuff i've done so i just listed what i can do and what i will be / am working on right now.

### features 

i've made it so there's an autoslide feature between the four main segments of my webpage, so that users are moved into a good viewing position while they scroll.

i've offset the appearance of elements to fade in when users scroll, which makes it seem like elements appear as the user goes down the page. i did this by making an interaction observer to indicate which part / segment of the page the user is on.

i've added some button elements that replace images and buttons, and one that replaces an image with a gif.

### installation

if this doesn't end up linking to agpalm25.github.io like i'm hoping it will, you can clone this repository, and run index.html in your browser to access my page.

### acknowledgements
